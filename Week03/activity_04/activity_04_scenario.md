This developed system will provide the following facilities for the university:
    1. Information about the teachers will be recorded. The information set will include name, email and degree of each teacher.
    2. Information about the students will be recorded. The information set will include name and email of each student.
    3. Information about the courses will be recorded. The information set will include name and credit of each course.
    4. ID information for teachers, students, and courses will be included as well, so it will be available if there is any functional usefulness or necessity.
    5. The system will provide ways to create the records for the data aforementioned.
    6. The system will provide ways to query or retrieved the recorded data aforementioned.

This developed system is a demonstrated version, so it will be creating the sample hard-coded data and will use those sample data to demonstrate the verification of the requirements proivded. The system will demonstrate the fulfilment of the following requirements.
    1. To display the total number of students for MSE800 (as per the sample data)
    2. To list all the teachers info, including name, who are teaching MSE801 (as per the sample data)

The following is the list of required future extentions to make this system usable in the practical scenario. 
    1. To use real data, i.e. to discard the sample data, and to retain data through out all the executions
    2. To provide the options to the user: to create data (for teacher, student or course) or to query data (1. to display the total number of studentes for MSE800 as per the data entered and 2. to list all the teachers who are teaching MSE801 as per the data entered)
